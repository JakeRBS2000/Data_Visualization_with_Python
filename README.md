# Data_Visualization_with_Python

(Coursera IBM Data Science Professional Certificate).

Introduction to data visualization tools (DV0101EN_Exec_Intro) = Learn about data visualization and some of the best practices to keep in mind when creating plots and visuals. Learning about the history and the architecture of Matplotlib and learn about basic plotting with Matplotlib. Learn how to read csv files into a pandas dataframe and process and manipulate the data in the dataframe, and how to generate line plots using Matplotlib.

- Describe the importance of data visualization.
- Relate the history of Matplotlib and its architecture.
- Apply Matplotlib to create plots using Jupyter notebooks.
- Read csv files into a Pandas DataFrame; process and manipulate the data in the DataFrame; andgenerate line plots using Matplotlib.

Basic and Specalised Visualization Tools (DV0101EN_Exec_AreaPlots_Histograms_BarCharts and DV0101EN_Exec_PieCharts_BoxPlots_ScatterPlots) = Learning about area plots and how to create them with Matplotlib, histograms and how to create them with Matplotlib, bar charts, and how to create them with Matplotlib, pie charts, and how to create them with Matplotlib, box plots and how to create them with Matplotlib, and scatter plots and bubble plots and how to create them with Matplotlib.

- Explain how to generate an area plot using Matplotlib.
- Describe why and how to create histograms using Matplotlib.
- Explain how to create bar charts.
- Create pie charts using Matplotlib.
- Create a box plot using Matplotlib.

Advanced Visualizations and Geospatial Data (DV0101EN_WafflesCharts_WordClouds and DV0101EN_Generating_Mpas_Python) = Learning about advanced visualization tools such as waffle charts and word clouds and how to create them. Also, about seaborn, which is another visualization library, and how to use it to generate attractive regression plots. In addition, Folium, which is another visualization library, designed especially for visualizing geospatial data. Finally, how to use Folium to create maps of different regions of the world and how to superimpose markers on top of a map, and how to create choropleth maps.

- Apply advanced visualization tools to create waffle charts and word clouds.
- Use Seaborn with Matplotlibto generate attractive regression plots.
- Explain how to use the Folium, for visualizing geospatial data.
- Use Folium to create maps and superpose markers.
- Create Choropleth Maps with Folium.
